    <h1>DlDataGrid widget</h1>

    <p>
      The new grid is made up of the following pieces:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        DlRecord — an object that keeps data for a single record (grid row)
      </li>
      <li>
        DlRecordCache — an object that maintains multiple records
      </li>
      <li>
        DlDataGrid — the widget itself
      </li>
      <li>
        DlGridCol — defines one column
      </li>
      <li>
        DlSelectionModel — object that handles the grid selection
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We'll discuss them all but for now only the first 3 are
      essentials.
    </p>

    <p>
      DlRecord and DlRecordCache represent the data model and
      DlDataGrid is the view.  The grid displays data from a record
      cache, but it doesn't necessarily display all records or all
      columns.  It actually displays a subset of the data (and of
      course, it can happen that this subset is the entire list).
    </p>

    <p>
      The new grid widget is centered around the idea that each record
      has an unique ID; the record cache doesn't maintain the order of
      the records, the grid is solely responsible about this.  In
      other words, we work as much as possible with record ID-s
      instead of row indexes.  This makes it easy to identify records
      when we communicate with the server irrespective of their actual
      positions inside the grid (which can be sorted, etc).
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's one verbose example:
    </p>

    [% INCLUDE show_sample.tt sample = 'test1' %]

    <p>
      You can already notice a few features of the new grid:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        You can select multiple rows by shift-click / ctrl-click.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you focused the grid, you can also use the keyboard to
        navigate and select; this was available in the old grid as
        well, actually, but some ugly hacks were needed to allow
        selection of multiple rows.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can drag and drop column headers to reorder columns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right clicking on the headers allow you to hide/show columns.
        Note that they even remember their positions ;-)
      </li>
      <li>
        Obviously, clicking the column header sorts the grid.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Paging and virtual scrolling</h2>

    <p>
      Speed was perhaps the most important factor that determined me
      to start a new grid widget from scratch (I think it's the fourth
      time in my life when I write a grid).  So before we move
      forward, let's compare the speed of the new grid to the speed of
      the old one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently you can see the old grid in action <a
      href="http://www.dynarchlib.com/dl/index.html#sample://widgets-grid.xml">at
      this address</a>.  Run sample #2.  On my machine (Intel Core
      Duo, 2GHz) and platform (Firefox 3 / Debian Linux) the sample
      shows up in 3 seconds.  Next I'll rewrite that sample for the
      new grid (in fact I'm anxious to see this too :D).
    </p>

    [% INCLUDE show_sample.tt sample = 'test2' %]

    <p>
      It takes like half a second for the new grid.  More, the time
      needed won't increase proportionally with the number of rows,
      because the grid actually displays only 50 rows.  As you scroll
      outside this area, the grid adds rows into view (you can notice
      a very slight flickering in Firefox, unfortunately I couldn't
      find a way around that).
    </p>

    <p>
      Virtual scrolling can be controlled by two parameters to
      DlDataGrid constructor:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>rpp</b> — “records per page”.  This defaults to 50.  The
          grid will keep <em>at most</em> this many records in the
          DOM.  If more records are to be displayed, they are
          displayed as the page is scrolled, if
          <b>virtualScrolling</b> is true.  Otherwise you need to
          provide a paging mechanism (i.e. "prev page" or "next page"
          buttons and use the grid's <b>displayPage</b> method).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>rpp</b> can also be zero or null, in which case the grid
          displays all records that are available.  This works best
          for a relatively small number of records (200 records and 10
          columns work decently fast in my tests).  For anything over
          200 records you really need <b>rpp</b> to be a small value
          (50 is best), otherwise the browser slows down to a crawl.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>virtualScrolling</b> : <b>true</b> | false — default is
          true; this boolean specifies if we want the grid to use
          virtual scrolling.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What's with resetIDS()?</h2>

    <p>
      As I mentioned above, the grid does not necessarily display all
      records from the data cache.  You need to explicitly tell the
      grid the ID-s of the rows that it should display.  This is done
      with resetIDS() which takes an array of ID-s.  This array also
      defines the initial order of the records in the display.
    </p>

    <h2>Grid columns</h2>

    <p>
      The grid internally creates a DlGridCol object for each column
      passed in the <b>columns</b> argument.  All the properties are
      passed to the DlGridCol constructor.  This object supports the
      following properties (showing the defaults):
    </p>

    <pre class="js" name="code">"id"        : null
"width"     : null
"style"     : null
"label"     : null
"tooltip"   : null
"iconClass" : null
"sortable"  : true
"resizable" : true
"visible"   : true</pre>

    <p>
      For example, if you want a column to be initially hidden, you
      need to pass visible: false, as shown in the next sample.  Note
      that it's not currently possible to <em>create</em> columns
      after the grid was initialized.  One can only hide or show them,
      therefore all columns must be specified from the start.
    </p>

    <h2>Selection model</h2>

    <p>
      When you construct the grid you can specify a selection model.
      If you don't, the grid creates its own and it's available in
      <b>grid._selection</b> (really not a public API), but normally
      you'll roll your own object.  Using it you can find out at any
      time what records are selected, as an array of record ID-s, or
      as a hash.  The following sample demonstrates it.
    </p>

    [% INCLUDE show_sample.tt sample = 'test3' %]

    <p>
      The selection model accepts a <b>multiple</b> argument (boolean)
      which defaults to true.  If you pass false there, the grid won't
      support multiple row selection.
    </p>

    <h2>Data changes</h2>

    <p>
      The grid “listens” to data changes in the cache and
      automatically refreshes the modified records, inserts or removes
      records, to match with the cache, therefore all you need to do
      is to modify the data model.  The following sample illustrates
      that.
    </p>

    [% INCLUDE show_sample.tt sample = 'test4' %]

    <p>
      One thing to notice is that upon an "onInsert" event the grid
      adds that row into the display, although it wasn't mentioned in
      resetIDS().  In general this is what we want.
    </p>

    <h2>Under the hood</h2>

    <p>
      Now that you know all the basics, it's time for some more
      advanced tips.  For example, what happens if inside some object
      you have a property which is a Date object?  The grid will
      display it by converting it to string, but it's hardly what you
      want to happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Probably the most important trick that's going to be useful in
      real applications is to inherit the DlRecord or/and
      DlRecordCache objects.  The following sample shows how we can
      create a custom DlRecordCache object.
    </p>

    [% INCLUDE show_sample.tt sample = 'test5' %]

    <p>
      There are other interesting functions in DlRecordCache which are
      automatically called by the grid and you can override:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>getRecClass(rec) { return a CSS class name for the given record }</li>
      <li>getCellClass(rec, col) { return a CSS class name for the given record and column }</li>
      <li>getRecords(ids, callback, obj) { see below }</li>
      <li>getInsertPos(rec) { return the position at which this newly inserted record should be displayed }</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When your data is huge, <b>getRecords</b> is of particular
      importance.  The default implementation simply calls
      cache.get(id) for each ID and returns the collected records, but
      this won't work when you're loading the data “lazily” from the
      server.  In such cases you need to override this method and make
      it request the data from the server.
    </p>

    <p>
      I will try to illustrate this in the next sample.  Note that
      it's a “client-side”-only sample, it doesn't load data from the
      server; it just generates it randomly after a timeout (to
      emulate the time spent into the client-server round trip).  The
      sample is a bit complicated, but I'll explain things below.
    </p>

    [% INCLUDE show_sample.tt sample = 'test6' %]

    <p>
      Now here's what happens.  When the grid needs to display data,
      it calls cache.getRecords().  This method receives a callback;
      the original idea was that this callback is supposed to be
      called with an array of full records, only after we retrieve
      data from server.  However in practice this didn't work because
      of the asynchronous nature of the AJAX calls — the browser being
      “free” while a call is active, the user can still scroll while
      the server is retrieving records for the first call.  Which
      means that by the time the records get cached in the client and
      the callback called, the user might view a totally different set
      of records.  This led to incredibly difficult to debug issues,
      so I gave up the idea.  SO, the right solution is to have the
      callback called right away; it will be passed an array that
      contains DlRecord objects, though some of them might be “fake”
      (i.e. not fully retrieved from server, which is why I'm using
      the _loading hack).  In this case, the grid will display "..."
      (as actually returned by the DlRecord::get() function) and
      later — when full data is available — we manually trigger the
      "onChange" event in the cache for those rows, so that the view
      gets updated.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can see in the code, it has to mess up with some
      internals of these objects — for instance it sets the recordSet
      for a created record manually to the cache, and it manually
      needs to modify the record._data — it would make sense, if we
      have a single column, to use record.set() in order to modify its
      value; but in the general case where we have to display a lot of
      columns, record.set() is not OK because it triggers the onChange
      event for each column, which is a waste of time since the grid
      actually re-displays the full row upon onChange.
    </p>

    <p>
      One other thing to notice here is that the grid instantly
      displays the value of “known” columns (in this case, the ID),
      while it waits for the other columns' value to come.  This is
      useful in many cases, i.e. when you want to display data from an
      SQL join.  An example where it's really useful: say you want to
      display a table of pages; each page contains some specific data
      (i.e. title, date created, etc) and each one is created by some
      user (first name, last name, date last seen, etc.; this data
      comes from a different table in DB).  You can cache these
      separately on the client.  Then, if you need to display a table
      that contains user comments, you also have some specific data
      (subject, date created, comment etc.) but you also have user's
      data which might have been already cached.  By defining your own
      cache and record objects you can achieve maximum flexibility
      needed for your application.
    </p>

    <h2>That's all for now</h2>

    <p>
      Until a full API reference for the new grid is available, I
      think I have covered most use cases so that's the end of this
      article.  Enjoy!
