      <doc>
        DlEventProxy is the base class of all widgets and of a few
        more other objects.  It implements a simple event dispatcher.
        Such an object has a set of events.  Each event can have one
        or more <em>listeners</em> (or <em>handlers</em>).  A listener
        is a plain JavaScript function and DlEventProxy will call all
        listeners for some event whenever that event is triggered.

        Event listeners will receive arguments as passed by the code
        that triggers the event.  There are no general rules here.
        Listeners that get called as a consequence of an UI event will
        generally receive a 〈DlEvent〉 object as argument.  Using it
        you will be able to tell the event type, mouse coordinates,
        keys pressed, etc.  However, other custom events will receive
        various other arguments (or no arguments at all).  We will
        properly document arguments for all events.

        Event listeners are called in the scope of the current object.
        If you want to change this, use 〈Function::closure()〉.

    <events>
      <event name="onDestroy">
        <doc>
          This is an event defined by DlEventProxy (so obviously it
          will be available in all derived objects).  It will be
          called by the framework when the object is destroyed.

          By default, 〈addEventListener()〉 will insert handlers for
          this event in reverse order, so it's safe to do anything you
          want with the object internals during this event.  The
          object should be effectively destroyed after all handlers
          have been executed.

      <method XXX="Code has changed!" hash="1949184d970271426a22ae111bbcac53" name="addEventListener">
        <param name="ev" type="String|Array|Hash">Event name</param>
        <param name="handler" type="Function">Event handler function</param>
        <param name="phase" optional="1" type="boolean">Add to front?</param>
        <doc>
          Adds a new handler for an existing event of this object.  In
          the simplest form you will call it for example like this:

          <js>
            function handlerFunction() {
              // do stuff upon destroy
            };
            object.addEventListener("onDestroy", handlerFunction);
          </js>

          However, as you can see, you can pass an Array or a Hash too
          as the event name.  If you pass an Array, it will assume
          that you want to add the same <b>handler</b> to all the
          events named in the array:

          <js>
            object.addEventListener([ "onMouseEnter", "onMouseLeave" ],
                                    mouseHandler);
          </js>

          If you pass a Hash, you get a nice way to add multiple
          different listeners for different events in an object:

          <js>
            object.addEventListener({ onMouseEnter : doMouseEnter,
                                      onMouseLeave : doMouseLeave,
                                      onMouseDown  : doMouseDown,
                                      onDestroy    : doDestroy });
          </js>

          You can get the same effect by calling addEventListener
          multiple times, but it's easier to use a Hash.

          If not passed, <b>phase</b> is by default <b>false</b>,
          except in the situation when the event name is "onDestroy"
          (then phase defaults <b>true</b>).  If you pass <b>true</b>,
          then your handler will be registered at the start; therefore
          when the event occurs, this listener will be called first.

        <doc>
          Removes the specified listener(s) from the object.  See
          〈addEventListener()〉 for syntax of the arguments.

        <param name="cond" type="boolean">Condition</param>
        <doc>
          This combines 〈addEventListener()〉 and
          〈removeEventListener()〉.  After <b>cond</b>, pass the same
          arguments that you would pass to those functions.
          condEventListener() will <em>add</em> the listeners if
          condition is <b>true</b>, or remove them if condition is
          <b>false</b>.

        <doc>
          Removes <em>all</em> listeners associated with an event.

      <method hash="5d4643bceabad0f4a424a3009b64b785" name="disableHooks">
        <param name="ev" type="String|Array">Event name(s)</param>
        <doc>
          Temporarily disables the listeners for the named event(s).
          You can restore them later with 〈enableHooks()〉.
        </doc>
      </method>

      <method hash="f62f276949901ee65194edadea42de65" name="enableHooks">
        <param name="ev" type="String|Array">Event name(s)</param>
        <doc>
          Restores listeners disabled by 〈disableHooks()〉.

          Note that between a call to disableHooks() and one to
          enableHooks(), you can add other listeners to the same
          event.  They will function correctly, but they will be lost
          after the call to enableHooks().

          Example where this might be useful:

          <js>
            field.addEventListener("onChange", function() {
              // do something heavy when field has changed
            });

            // ... later, "something heavy" is already done for the
            // value we plan to put into the field, so we don't want
            // the handler to get called now:

            field.disableHooks("onChange");
            field.changeTo(new_value);
            field.enableHooks("onChange");
          </js>

          (In practice it's better to add an argument to the changeTo
          function so that it knows it shouldn't call the hooks; we're
          doing this in few of our widgets).

          You will normally call this only once for each object,
          i.e. in the constructor.  It will register the given events
          with the current object.

          <js>
            var evs = new DlEventProxy();
            evs.registerEvents([ "onFoo", "onBar" ]);
            // now we can use the new events:
            evs.addEventListener("onFoo", function(param) {
               alert("Got: " + param);
            });
            evs.callHooks("onFoo", "Hello World");
          </js>
        </doc>
      </method>

      <method hash="1d0e4709ccbbdc47b52d5dcd26eebccb" name="connectEvents">
        <param name="e1" type="String|Array">Event_1 name(s)</param>
        <param name="w2" type="DlEventProxy|String|Array">Target object (or Event_2 name(s))</param>

          I consider this function complicated and dangerous.
          <b>Don't use it.</b>

          It connects an event (Event_1) from the current object to
          some event (Event_2) in the target object.  If the target
          object is the same as the current object, you can omit it
          and only pass the second event.

          Connected events simply means that when Event_1 is triggered
          in the current object, Event_2 will be automatically
          triggered in the target object.

          You can call it in a few ways:

          <js>
            // if our hypotetical object has "onChange" event for when
            // the value changes, and "onRefresh" for updating the display
            // we can connect onRefresh to onChange to have it redisplay
            // automatically when the value has changed:
            obj.connectEvents("onChange", "onRefresh");

            // or, suppose that our data is handled by "obj", and the
            // display of this data is handled by "view", then we do:
            obj.connectEvents("onChange", view, "onRefresh");

            // if both events have the same name you can omit Event_2:
            view1.connectEvents("onRefresh", view2); // keep views in sync

            // you can pass an array as well, to connect multiple events:
            view1.connectEvents([ "onRefresh", "onResize" ], view2);
          </js>

      <method XXX="Code has changed!" hash="ab6c9693c470952ef374272ed5c3ee55" name="applyHooks">

        <param name="args" type="Array">Arguments to pass to listeners</param>
        <doc>
          Triggers the named event, which effectively means that all
          the associated listeners will be called in order.  Any
          arguments in the <b>args</b> Array will be passed to
          handlers.

          Same as 〈applyHooks()〉, but arguments are received normally,
          rather than in an array.  This function is theoretically
          slower, since it creates an array of arguments internally
          then calls 〈applyHooks()〉.

          The following 2 are equivalent:

          <js>
            obj.callHooks("myEventName", foo, 2, bar);
            obj.applyHooks("myEventName", [ foo, 2, bar ]);

      <method hash="fb17e0d572a971f8d77d884a3289fc58" name="destroy">
        <doc>
          This is the standard way to destroy objects in DynarchLIB.
          You might think JavaScript doesn't need this, but in fact it
          needs it even more badly than “lower level” languages such
          as C++.

          You should never override this function in derived objects;
          instead, if you want something to happen upon destruction,
          add a handler for the "onDestroy" event.
